                Part-1 ( For Freshmen Year )
                From the past few days, many freshmen year students are messaging me :
                “ Hello Sir, Where should we start learning to be a developer or programmer ?”
            </p>
            <p class="lede">
                Well, this question also arises when I was in my freshman year. I didn’t know what to start and from where should I learn? So, I will share my experience to be a Developer and how can you?

                    Competitive Programming is a sport where many developers code together to find one possible code that took less execution time and less memory space. I recommend for a freshman to start with Competitive Programming as soon as possible and practice daily.

                Competitive Programming makes our Data Structures strong and It is important for our placements. It is asked by Big MNC’s like Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Facebook, etc. They conduct many programming competitions :

                Get Into Local Tech Communities in you City or College
                Now, I know you all are having some questions in mind?

                What are Communities ?
            </p>
            <p class="lede">
                Communities are a group of developers who organize meetups on any technology and have a communication channel to be a part of those communities. It is important to be part of a community for networking as well as learning new things or in other words, you will have expert contacts and always learn new tech to start. You can also share your project idea and get started with a new team.

                A great saying by the great person always goes in my mind every day and I recommend you to follow it and it will take you one step closer to Leadership.

                If there are no communities nearby you then you can start your own community within the campus or city. Some exclusive communities every city or college should have:

                <ul class="lede-list">
                    <li class="lede-list__item"><a href="https://developers.google.com/programs/community/gdg/directory/">Google Developer Group ( GDG )</a></li>

                </ul>

                <p class="lede">You can start your own community or club within your college but I can say from my personal experience that most of the times it shuts down. So, try to be a part of a factor where you have someone senior to report.</p>

                Unfortunately, When I was in my freshmen year I can only crack the Competitive Programming part but didn’t get any achievements. I write this article for those who didn’t get either part of it. If any queries can contact me.
